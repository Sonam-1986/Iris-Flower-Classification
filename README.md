# 🌸 **Iris Flower Classification Project**

## 📘 **Project Overview**

The **Iris Flower Classification Project** is a machine learning model built using the famous **Iris dataset** to classify flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — based on their sepal and petal dimensions.
This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow — from **data analysis** and **visualization** to **model training, evaluation, and saving**.

## 🎯 **Objectives**

* To perform **data exploration** and understand feature relationships in the Iris dataset.
* To train and evaluate multiple **supervised learning algorithms** for flower classification.
* To compare model performance and visualize results for better interpretability.
* To demonstrate how trained models and plots can be **automatically saved** for reuse.



## ⚙️ **Tools and Technologies Used**

* **Python 3** — Core programming language.
* **NumPy & Pandas** — For data analysis and preprocessing.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** — For data visualization (pairplots, histograms, confusion matrices).
* **Scikit-learn (sklearn)** — For model building, training, and evaluation.
* **Joblib** — For saving trained models.
* **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook** — For development and experimentation.



## 🌟 **Features**

* 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  Generates visual insights using pairplots and histograms to explore feature distributions.
* 🤖 **Model Training:**
  Trains and compares multiple ML algorithms — Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree.
* 🎯 **Model Evaluation:**
  Displays **accuracy**, **confusion matrices**, and **classification reports** for each model.
* 💾 **Model Saving:**
  Automatically saves trained models (`.joblib`) in a `/models` folder.
* 📈 **Visualization Output:**
  Saves plots (pairplots, histograms, confusion matrices) under `/plots` for easy access.
* 🧠 **Automated Pipeline:**
  End-to-end script — from loading data to training and evaluating models in a single run.



## 💡 **Applications**

* 🎓 **Educational Tool:**
  Ideal for students and beginners learning machine learning and classification fundamentals.
* 🔬 **Data Science Demonstrations:**
  Showcases end-to-end model building, visualization, and evaluation using real data.
* 🧩 **Template Project:**
  Can be easily extended for other classification datasets or ML experiments.
* 🌼 **Research & Experimentation:**
  Useful for analyzing relationships between features in biological or plant datasets.


## 🧰 **How to Run**
